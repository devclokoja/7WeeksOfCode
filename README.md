Last year November (2019), we [announced the first #DevCLokoja30DaysofCode challenge](https://facebook.com/groups/devclokoja/permalink/2564914083584282/) for members of Facebook Developer Circle Lokoja to help members improve their programming skills or get started in programming by learning and writing code for 30 days in a row and get rewarded for their efforts (Here is the [report](https://devclokoja.hashnode.dev/devclokoja30daysofcode-season-i-recap-ck5pglsff0639qps1i39r8jh4) from the first season).

We would be continuing this program by extending it to a 7 weeks learning challenge where DevCLokoja members can improve their programming skills or get started in programming by learning and writing code for 7 weeks in a row and get rewarded for their efforts.

Members will choose a category to learn from and we would provide a recommended list of FREE tutorials and resources members during these 7 weeks and engage them daily with motivation, more resources and tips.

This challenge starts on 11TH MAY 2020 and ends on the 22ND JUNE 2020.
